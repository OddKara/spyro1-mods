# Kara's Spyro 1 Mod Repo
This a collection of all the Spyro 1 mods I've made/am working on. None of this is going to be particularly organized and it's mainly for people who are just interested in seeing the source code. All these mods were made using RodHot's [PSX Modding Toolchain](https://github.com/mateusfavarin/psx-modding-toolchain)

## Xdelta Patches
Because of copyright I cannot share a modified spyro ROM on github. Instead, all my mods are released as xdelta files in the "Patches" folder. You'll have to aquire a Spyro the Dragon ROM yourself but once you have it, visit this [Xdelta Patcher](https://kotcrab.github.io/xdelta-wasm/). The original Spyro ROM is the "Source File" and the Xdelta file is the "Patch File".
